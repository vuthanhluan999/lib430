=MSP430 Code Library=

This Google code location is meant as a library source for Texas Intruments' MSP430 Microcontrollers.

It starts out especially with code for devices on the Launchpad and C language.
I have most of the code for the devices and modules on the ToDo list in Assembly language but I thnik it's much more flexible to make them available in C too.
Im also working on a booster pack for the Lauchpad containing most of the sensors.
